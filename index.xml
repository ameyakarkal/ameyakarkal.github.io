      <description>The company that I worked for had an interesting problem to solve. They had recently &amp;ldquo;acquired&amp;rdquo; a consultant who provided custom reporting services to higher education institutions which was highly labor intensive and manual. We were asked to fully automate the workflow incrementally AND onboard existing clients
powerbi azure-storage azure-data-factory azure-web-app powerbi-embeded azure-functions azure-entra
What were the challenges? The existing process was very custom and manual in nature. The consultant custom transformed data files from the institutions, loaded them into an on prem database to perform transformations and imported the results into a power bi report.</description>

      <description>I was working as a full time Senior Software Developer in a project that indexed data generated by multiple data sources. This legacy system had outgrown from its initial single responsibility of &amp;ldquo;managing indicies in ElasticSearch&amp;rdquo; to handle more things were vague but still could be bucketed in the managing indicies bucket
The product that used this service had a requirement for a data source that could handle analytical query workload.</description>

      <description>In 2018, I was involved in designing and building a workflow that would allow sharing data between multiple products of the same campany on a single enterprise platform. The company had an enterprise contract with Microsoft Azure, with almost all of their infrastructure built and deployed across regions in azure. Building this workflow using the tools available in azure was a no brainer.

      <description>I worked on a project that involved sending surveys to students enrolled in higher education degree institutions at end of the semester.
serverless azure-functions storage queue micro-service scaling
What were the challenges? We used a legacy windows service built on dotnet framework with a crusty cron job system built on top of Quartz to send emails The process was chunky and could not scale to the demands of the growing product This was a multi-tenant service however, issues in one tenant affected performance and quality of service offered to other tenants There were too many unknowns about if and when the emails would be delivered, this was more of a spaghetti implementation of the older service It lacked tools for internal support people and clients to manage expectations and achieve their goals Solution?</description>
