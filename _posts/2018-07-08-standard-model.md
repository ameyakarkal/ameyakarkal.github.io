## First Generation

- electron
- up quark
- down quark
- neutrino

## Second Generation
these are heavier clones of the first generation particles. these can be made in high energy collisons but are highly unstable and do not hang around for a long time.
- muons (for electron)
- muon neutrino 
- charm muon (for up quark)
- strange muon (for down quark)

## Third Generation

- tau (for electron)
- tau neutrino
- top quark (for up quark)
- bottom quark (for down quark)

## Force particles

- photon (electro magnetic force, binds electron to the atom, light itself is electro magnetic phenomenon)
- gluon (strong nuclear force, it binds the quarks together, binds )
- W boson and Z boson (weak nuclear force, it makes particles decay. muon decays into electron and gives out a photon)
