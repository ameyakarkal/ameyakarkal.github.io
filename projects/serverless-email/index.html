serverless azure-functions storage queue micro-service scaling
What were the challenges?

We used a legacy windows service built on dotnet framework with a crusty cron job system built on top of Quartz to send emails
The process was chunky and could not scale to the demands of the growing product
This was a multi-tenant service however, issues in one tenant affected performance and quality of service offered to other tenants
There were too many unknowns about if and when the emails would be delivered, this was more of a spaghetti implementation of the older service
It lacked tools for internal support people and clients to manage expectations and achieve their goals

Solution?

scalable We designed and implemented an end to end replacement built on top of azure functions and azure storage tables and queues. Azure Durable functions were still out yet.
Emphasis was given to make the system transparent to troubleshoot and manage the workflow for developers, internal support staff and clients alike
release strategy Email as a presentation layer gives you zero room for making mistakes that can be corrected. We released this iteratively moving few tenants over at a time
