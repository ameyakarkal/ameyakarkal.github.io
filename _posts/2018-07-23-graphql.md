# introduction
I started exploring GraphQL for the first time, I am using http://graphqlhub.com to play with the Github API

GraphQL can be sorted into following parts : 

# Fields
```
    github {
        user(username:"ameyakarkal"){
            id
        }
    }
```

- scaler : cannot be futher broken down, `id` in the above example
- complex : can be futher broken down,`github` and  `user` in the above example

Fields are modelled after javascript function. It is this *Resolver* function that needs to be executed

# Alias 
```
    github{
        user(username: "ameyakarkal"){
            github_id: id
        }
    }
```
used for 

# Variable

you can define a variable which can be passed as a JSON via the variables tab

```json
// example of a GraphQL query with a variable

// passing variable
```

# Directives

Sometimes, it is necessary to add additional logic on the fields. For example include or skipping a field when a flag is set. This can be achieved using a directive

```json
// example of a GraphQL query with a directive
```

# Fragments

A fragment helps to reduce redundant structure

# Inline Fragments

Help to query objects have multiple type. 

For example, A login can be a `Student` or `Faculty` for a school. Both the types represent a `Person`


# Mutation

Write data to the server

```
